# Voice-Controlled IoT Device like Alexa

## üìñ Overview

This project is a voice-controlled IoT device designed to recognize and process voice commands, similar to how Amazon Alexa operates.  
The primary objective is to create a smart assistant that can understand spoken queries, process them using advanced natural language processing, and provide audible responses in real-time.

This project serves as an excellent hands-on learning experience, offering practical skills in hardware integration, embedded systems, networking, and cloud services.  
It also provides exposure to cutting-edge technologies like speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) engines.

## ‚ú® Features

* **üó£Ô∏è Voice Recognition**: The device continuously listens for voice commands and converts them into text using the `SpeechRecognition` library.  
* **üß† Natural Language Processing**: It integrates with the **OpenAI API** to send text queries to ChatGPT, enabling it to handle a wide range of topics and generate dynamic, informative responses.  
* **üîä Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Provides verbal feedback by converting text responses from ChatGPT into speech using the `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) library.  
* **üîå IoT Integration**: Capable of communicating with other IoT devices and services through protocols like **MQTT** and **HTTP**.  
* **üîß Customization**: Allows for personalization of the assistant's voice (e.g., male/female) and can tailor responses based on user preferences.

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   * Connect the microphone and speaker to the microcontroller.  
   * Test the components to ensure they are functioning correctly.  

2. **Voice Recognition Development**:
   * Implement the speech-to-text (STT) functionality using the `SpeechRecognition` library.  
   * Capture voice input and convert it into a text string for processing.  

3. **Command Processing with ChatGPT**:
   * Set up your OpenAI API key.  
   * Send the text query to the ChatGPT API via an HTTP request.  
   * Receive and parse the response from the API.  

4. **Text-to-Speech Implementation**:
   * Use the `gTTS` library to convert the text response from ChatGPT into an audio file.  
   * Play the audio file through the connected speaker to provide an audible response.  

5. **Integration and Testing**:
   * Combine all modules into a single, cohesive system.  
   * Test the device with various voice queries to ensure accuracy and performance.  
   * Optimize the system for better response times and reliability.

## üì¶ Usage

To use the device, simply state your command or question aloud.  
The device will continuously listen, process your request using ChatGPT, and provide a spoken response through the speaker.

You: "Hey assistant, what's the weather like today?"
Assistant: "The weather today is sunny with a high of 32 degrees Celsius."
